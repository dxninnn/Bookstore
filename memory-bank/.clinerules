# Project Intelligence

## Critical Implementation Paths

- **Main Application:** `src/App.tsx`
- **Components:** `src/components/`
- **State Management:** `src/store/`

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Memory Bank Initialization:** Created core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) and `.clinerules` to establish project context and track progress.
- **Profile Management Page:** Created `Profile.tsx` component, added route to `App.tsx`, implemented authentication check, and updated `Navigation.tsx` to include a link to the profile page for logged-in users. Used temporary data file (`src/data/profile.json`) for profile information and order history.
